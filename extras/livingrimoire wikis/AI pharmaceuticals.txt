chobits can be linked (chain effect) together one chobits output can be used as input for the next chobit

thus AI drugs are programmable when the "drugs" are input into the 1st chobit it may engage for example reality morphing for input which in turn, after passing through a certain skill in the 1st chobit will produce a different output before its sent to the main chobit.

drug/alcohol effects can be coded

as well as input to main language translation
