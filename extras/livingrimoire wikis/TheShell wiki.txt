The shell is a unique livingrimoire skill. it enables installing and uninstalling skills while the code is running.

***


main code example use(Java):
SELECT CONTENT
Code:
>         Sh_Brain b1 = new Sh_Brain();
>         b1.setShell(new TheShell(b1));
>         // adding all skills:
>         b1.addLogicSkill("hello world", new DiHelloWorld());
>         b1.addHardwareSkill("output",new DiSysOut()); // this skill prints output
>         // ^ shell filled with skills
>         b1.doIt("install output", "","");
>         b1.doIt("install hello world", "","");
>         b1.doIt("hello", "","");
>         b1.doIt("abolish hello world", "","");
>         b1.doIt("hello", "","");
>         System.out.println("skill reinstall:");
>         b1.doIt("install hello world", "","");
>         b1.doIt("hello", "","");

output:

hardware skill has been installed
logic skill has been installed
hello world
logic skill has been uninstalled
skill reinstall:
logic skill has been installed
hello world

up till now the coder would hardcode the skills he wants the LivinGrimoire AGI software design patten, then
run the code.

TheShell enables modifying the skills which the livingrimoire is equipped with while the program is running.

so you can simply add all the skills to TheSkill, start running the program and then add/remove skills to the livingrimoire object using key phrases.

much like the install and uninstall commands command shells use to enable more commands.
shell brain is a replacement to the Brain class if you want to use TheShell skill.
