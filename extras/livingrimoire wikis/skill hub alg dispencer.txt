super class to output an algorithm out of a selection of skills engage the hub with dispenseAlg(method) and, return the value to the outAlg attribute of the containing skill (which houses the skill hub)

this module enables using a selection of 1 skill for triggers instead of, having the triggers engage on multiple skills.

**the method is ideal for learnability and behavioral modifications :**
use a learnability auxiliary module as a condition to run an active skill shuffle or change method (rndAlg , cycleAlg)

moods can be used for specific cases to change behavior of the AGI, for example low energy state for that use the moodAlg method
