in the main file add this function(Python code):

import os

# noinspection PyUnusedLocal
def call_add_DLC_skills(brain: Brain):
    for file in os.listdir('.'):
        if file.endswith('.py') and 'DLC' in file:
            module_name = file[:-3]
            exec(f"import {module_name}")
            exec(f"{module_name}.add_DLC_skills(brain)")

in the running code area add:
call_add_DLC_skills(brain)

this will add skills via .py files with DLC in their file name.

each DLC file must have the following function:

def add_DLC_skills(brain: Brain):

example adding skills in the DLC file:

def add_DLC_skills(brain: Brain):
    brain.add_logical_skill(DiHelloWorld())
    brain.add_logical_skill(DiTime())

the method is called:
dynamic module loading and function invocation.

DLC stands for Downloadable Content.

there are several merits to this DLC protocol of adding skills:

1. the main file gets cleaner, and now focuses on the UI logic.
2. skill groups can be split and catagorized in DLC files:
(hardware skillls, robotic skills, logical skills, async skills and so on)
3. skills can be added via adding DLC files, without any coding
4. a group of skills is referred to as mentality, and a whole group can be
added by adding a DLC file.
5. additional DLC file logic can be implemented in the main file such as:
downloading additional DLCs or replacing the active DLCs based on input.
