the class AbsDictionaryDB is the livingrimoires database
it has load and a save methods

func save(key:String, value: String)
func load(key:String)->String

they can be accessed in a skill via kokoro.grimoireMemento


the livingrimoire saves alg part mutations and load them at start up from the database
assuming a subclass of AbsDictionaryDB was used, other wise it's simply a blueprint
for a database, but no error will occure

alg durations are not saved by default, they can be shallow referenced via the personality
or chobits class and save outside this classes, or loaded into them with the setter methon.

algorithm duration is how many think cycles an algorithm took to run the last time it run
and it is used by the livingrimoire to decide the run rpiority of an algorithm compared to other
algorithms requests to run
