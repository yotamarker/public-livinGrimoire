AP classes : extend the AbsAlgPart
those classes encapsulate the actual action or skill
APCuss : will cuss using the same word while the cause of the cuss is detected

APDirtyTalk : dirty talks with the user
conjuratis : "ok next" finishes the AP
c'tor : APDirtyTalk(Hashtable<String, String> hashtable)
gets a dirty talk DB as a dictionary. *that must start with "start"
further dev recommended : output filter : I U we they convert to U I and so on
advanced ver will learn new scripts, using vision and other techniques

APMoan : this is the moaning stage that comes after the dirty talk forplay AP in the algorithm.
a rather primitive moan system with preset moans :
moan0 to 2 = default moans, IMoan1 to 3 = moans when doll moved
thank you moan : finisher groan
private void playMoan(String input) {
is responsible for working the moan * could do this async

APSay : say x, y times

APSleep0  : sleeps : activates the private void sleep of the chobit class

APSleep : simulates sleep, until wake time or special wake input was inputed
*such input must undergo translation (noise = "wake up")and an if code line in the action function.

APSpell : can activate without permission(chobit name or hidden name)
such as telling times

D classes : extends the AbsCmdReq

this classes summon the AP classes using conjuratis(regex)

DDirtyTalker  : dirty talk *
replace * with fuck
or program more options instead of *

Detective : this is a special DClass it doesn't use conjuratis
it is triggered by danger and negativity :
cussing
repeated input
too much requests
need to add : damage : body, friends, property, * time(cerabellum time out)

DPermitter : checks for the chobit name or lv 2 name before sending
a request to the other Dclasses.
sexy classes would require lv2 name
conjuratis :
change pass : oldPass new password newPassword change lv1 name :
pass your name is newName change lv2 name : pass you are newName

DRules : scheduled continuoes sync actions
contains sleep summon triggered by time

DSayer : says stuff
say x # times or say x

chobit : see class
