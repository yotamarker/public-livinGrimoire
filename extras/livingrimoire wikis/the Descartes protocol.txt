by using shallow reference as a skill attribute, the skill gains:
awareness and or control over it's environment.

in this example the skill parameter has a shallow reference to the animation environment.
```
```def setAnimationSkill(self, skill: DiSkillV2):
```    self.brain.hardwareChobit.removeSkill(self.animation)
```    self.animation = skill
```    self.brain.hardwareChobit.addSkill(self.animation)
```
this lets the skill gain the ability to control the animation, as well as transfer
the animation logic into a skill.
