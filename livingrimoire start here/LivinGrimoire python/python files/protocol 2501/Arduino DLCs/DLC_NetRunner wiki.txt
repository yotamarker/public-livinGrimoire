DLC_NetRunner for URL hacking

the DLC_NetRunner is a LivinGrimoire skill.

because this is a DLC file, all you need to add the skill to a LivinGrimoire object is
add the file to the Python project, see wiki for more detail on LivinGrimoire DLC protocol:
https://github.com/yotamarker/public-livinGrimoire/wiki/LivinGrimoire-DLC-protocol-2501

twiking the skill (just modify the iitems in the list):
exclusions = ['google.com', 'bing.com', 'facebook.com', 'youtube.com']  # sites to exclude from link scouting
site_seeds = ['https://www.yotamarker.com/']  # site you want to scout for internal/external links
site_fuel: list[str] = ['', 'yotamarker', 'coding', 'java', 'python', 'cplusplus', 'swift']  # lists used for domain guessing
site_fuel2: list[str] = ['', 'forum', 'haven']
site_endings = ['.com', '.org', '.net', '.io', '.co', '.edu', '.gov', '.info', '.biz', '.moe', 'ninja']  # domain endings for URL guessing

you're gonna to love sliding, there is no telling which site you will arrive at.
it all depends on the items in your seed_fuel list.

URL hacking enables you to arrive to sites where Search Engines won't take you,
the very outskirts of the internet.
