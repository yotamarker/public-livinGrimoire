as it's name implies, this skill lets the programmer bundle multiple skills together.
DiSkillBundle or a subclass of it can be used.

***

        Brain b1 = new Brain();<br>
        DiSkillBundle dsb = new DiSkillBundle();<br>
        dsb.addSkill(new DiHelloWorld());<br>
        dsb.addSkill(new DiTime());<br>
        b1.logicChobit.addSkill(dsb);<br>

bundling skills together has several merits:

better readability
* faster skill equiping(several at once)
* combined with a SkillBranch, a bundle of skills can mutate together into other skills, 
or skill bundles. this also means enablement of burst modes in which every microsecond counts,
and the bundle can use a skill branch to mutate into a bundle of a few essential skills.
* creation of new skills.
* it is a little bit faster than unbundled skills, because on activation of an algorithm
the bundle skips to the stage of sending out the Algorithm.
* organizing skill sets into bundles means cleaner and more readable code.
