Polymerization of skills. the binding of several skills into one skill!
this enables:
1 auto learnability: the object learns to optimize which skill will be active
2 usage of same triggers for a bundle of skills, engaging only with the active skill
3 bundling skills in categories

example use:
        SkillBranch sb = new SkillBranch(3);
        sb.addDefcon("lame");
        sb.addGoal("thanks");
        sb.addSkill(new DiSmoothie0());
        sb.addSkill(new DiSmoothie1());
        b1.logicChobit.addSkill(sb);
