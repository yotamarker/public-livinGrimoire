super class to output an algorithm out of a selection of skills
engage the hub with dispenseAlg and return the value to the containing the outAlg attribute
of the containing skill (which houses the skill hub)
this module enables using a selection of 1 skill for triggers instead of having the triggers engage on multible skill
the methode is ideal for learnability and behavioral modifications
use a learnability auxiliary module as a condition to run an active skill shuffle or change methode
(rndAlg , cycleAlg)
moods can be used for specific cases to change behavior of the AGI, for example low energy state
for that use (moodAlg)
