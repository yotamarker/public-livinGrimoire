arduino is a microcontroller used to controll robots.

an arduino shield is a part you connect to an arduino board to increase its available functions.

most popular arduino board variations :

Arduino Uno : popular board for begginers
Arduino Mega: if you need more input/output ports
Arduino nano :small scale arduino boards

to code an arduino board you need the arduino IDE installed on your computer
then send the code via USB cable to the arduino board.

arduino IDE DL link :

https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/

when connecting the board make sure the IDE recognizes it :
tools->choose your board
next select the usb port
tools->port
(the board needs to be connected only when you are ready to send the compiled code)
there is a V btn to compile and an arrow btn to send the code to the arduino board

the IDE has example code.
file->examples->basics->blink

every arduino code cosists of 2 functions :
1 setup : runs once
2 loop : runs non stop
