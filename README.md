**LivinGrimoire** is a software design pattern that absorbs skills with just one line of code needed to add a skill.

#### Advantages of LivinGrimoire

1. **Skill Prioritization**: Can prioritize skills against one another, pause and resume skills according to their priority.
2. **Algorithm Queueing**: Can queue algorithms while running other algorithms.
3. **Concurrent Skill Engagement**: Can engage several skills at once and engage the right skills.
4. **Inter-Skill Communication**: Skills can communicate with each other, pass data, and affect each other.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Interface is not used, making it applicable for all OOP programming languages.
6. **Auxiliary Classes**: Specialized for learnability and trigger management, with miscellaneous classes for time savings on common coding actions.
7. **Multistep Algorithms**: Can form multistep algorithms and abort algorithms while they run.
8. **Built-In Skill Catalog**: Features a built-in skill catalog (see wiki to learn more).
9. **Dynamic Skill Management**: Can use self-aware skills, enabling them to add or remove other skills while the program is running, similar to a command terminal (see TheShell wiki).
