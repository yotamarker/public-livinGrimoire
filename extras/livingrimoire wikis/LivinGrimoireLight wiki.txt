the LivinGrimoirLight is a light version of the LivinGrimoire software design pattern,
meant to run on Arduino/Elegoo microcontrollers.

it's written in Arduino C++.

only one line of code is needed to add a skill to the Arduino(multiple skills can be added).

using the LivinGrimoireLight on one's Arduino solves problems like spaghetti code,
and code debt.

a livingrimoirelight skill can be anything from lighting a LED, moving a motor to reading
a temperature sensor.

instead of diving into the code, it suffices to use the one line of code to add the skill
to the Arduino.

there is also a hello world example using a Led.
