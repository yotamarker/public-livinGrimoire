so at this point you wonder why does the ChobitV2 class implements thinkable ?

this is a beef up, which enables daisy chaining chobits using a Brain class.
said brain class has input flow through a list of chobits(AGIs), and ending up in
a cerabellum class which is responsible for executing codes in the real world, meaning
speaking words, moving robotics, changing screen backgrounds, sending SMS and other such codes.

this daisy chain process enables AI pharmaceuticals, as can be seen in the Brain class documentation :
/*
* chobit hierarchy and responsibilities within the Brain class, which is a
* Chobit daisy chain.
*
* higher lv chobits : reality distortion on drug intake, and input
* translations(such as languages) lower lv chobits : drug addictions, context
* sensitive translation of outputs, and primitive behaviors. primitive
* behaviors : algorithm,s that do not require items and are not dependant on
* time or place
