the brain class contains a chobits object and an actionable object.

said actionable object, is responsible to translate the chobit class output into
a "hardware" action.

by hardware action, I mean speaking, walking, using smart house functionality, make a call
and such.

the actionable class is an MVC design pattern class. it can have a shallow reference
to the *main class's hardware functions, while keeping all the algorithmic logic in itself

thus, the brain class has 2 features:

1. it keeps the main class as clean as possible with a minimum amount of code
2. *copype the main class and the brain related classes, is all that is needed to customize a
liviGrimoire project or waifu to use specific hardware capabilities.

main class :
this is where the program code starts to run

copype :
short for copy and paste
