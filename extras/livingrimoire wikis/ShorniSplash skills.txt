# Asynchronous Skills: Empowering Your Codebase!

Welcome to the world of asynchronous skills! 
These little gems are like the secret agents of your code—they operate independently, 
silently, and with purpose.

## What Are Asynchronous Skills?
Think of them as the virtuosos of parallelism. These skills are subclasses of the 
formidable ShorniSplash skill. 

## But what sets them apart? 

They possess the art of asynchronous execution—a dance that happens on a separate CPU core. 

***


place the code you want to run asynchronously in the async_func (static function)
override(in the subclass skill). also override the trigger method of the skill to set
it's engagement condition.

**see code example in the python version async_skills file.**
https://github.com/yotamarker/public-livinGrimoire/blob/master/livingrimoire%20start%20here/LivinGrimoire%20python/python%20files/async_skills.py

the code in the async function will run on a daemon thread asynchronously on a separate
CPU core from the main program, ensuring a smooth run.

if your skill code takes a while to run, for example making an API request, getting
an RSS feed and such, you should use this async technique.

## Naming Conventions
These skills deserve epic names. Start them with "Da" (representing "the async"). 
Imagine you're christening a digital superhero!
