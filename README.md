the LivinGrimoire is a software design pattern, that absorbs skills.
1 line of code is needed to add a skill.

advantages of the LivinGrimoire include:

1. can prioritize skills against one another, pause and resume skills according to their priority
2. can que algorithm while running other algorithms
3. can engage several skills at once, and engage the right skills.
4. inter skill communication: skills can communicate with each other, pass data, and effect each other
5. interface is not used, which means it is applicable for all OOP programming languages, meaning cross platform porting.
6. has lots of auxiliary classes specialized for learnability and trigger management as well as misc. classes for time savings on common coding actions.
7. can form multistep algorithms, as well as abort algorithms while they run.
