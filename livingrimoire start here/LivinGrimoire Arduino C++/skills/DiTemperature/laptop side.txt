Make sure you have the pyserial library installed. 
You can install it using pip using the PyCharm terminal tab:

pip install pyserial

Python code:

import serial
import time

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600, timeout=1)  # Adjust 'COM3' to your port

    num_readings = 10

    for _ in range(num_readings):
        if ser.in_waiting > 0:
            line = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').rstrip()
            print(line)
        time.sleep(1)  # Delay between readings

    ser.close()

ser.readline().decode('utf-8').rstrip() reads one line of data from the serial buffer, 
which corresponds to the last complete line sent from the Arduino. Each call to ser.readline() 
retrieves the next line of data available in the buffer, so if the Arduino is continuously 
sending data, this command will read the most recent line that has been fully transmitted.
