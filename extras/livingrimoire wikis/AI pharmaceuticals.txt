AI pharmaceuticals are LivinGrimoire skills, with shallow reference to the external environment of a livingrimoire object.
naming convention: Pill_skillName

example 1 : a pill skill can change the interval duration of a tick event, which triggers the livingrimoire.

AI drugs can also be made to effect specific skills, so long as the effected skills are equipped with some form of receptor code to react
with the drug's special input.
